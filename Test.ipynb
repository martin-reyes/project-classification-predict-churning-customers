    "## Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "23% of current customers on record have churned. In this project, we will aim to find drivers in customer churn by  exploring data acquired on our MySQL database. We will explore features both individually and relative to customer churn status. We will take these insights, present them, and use them to create machine learning models to predict whether a customer churns. After evaluating the models with metrics that address our goals, we will use the models to come up with recommendations and predictions on churningn customers.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## Project Goal\n",
    " \n",
    "* Discover drivers of customers churning and other key insights.\n",
    "* Use main drivers to develop a machine learning model to predict churning customers.\n",
    "* Use insights and model evaluation to identify features to address when a customer is predicted to churn.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## Initial Thoughts\n",
    " \n",
    "My initial hypothesis is our demographic features, gender and senior citizen status, will not relate to churn while our numerical features (tenure, monthly charges, and total charges) will.\n",
    " \n",
    "## The Plan\n",
    " \n",
    "* **Acquire** data from MYSQL\n",
    " \n",
    "* **Prepare** data. \n",
    "    1. Inspect raw data and note any desired transformations which may include any of the following:\n",
    "        * Drop unnecessary columns (duplicate, redundant columns)\n",
    "        * Numeric columns should be numeric data types\n",
    "        * Handle missing values and impute appropriate values\n",
    "            * check for explicit missing values (e.g. `np.nan`)\n",
    "            * check for implicit missing values (e.g. whitespace, `'unknown'`, etc.)\n",
    "        * Deal with any duplicate rows\n",
    "        * Address and encode categorical columns\n",
    "            * one-hot encode unordered categorical columns\n",
    "            * label encode ordered categorical columns  \n",
    "    1. Inspect clean data\n",
    "        * Ensure data is tidy:\n",
    "            * one value per cell\n",
    "            * each observation is one and only one row\n",
    "            * each feature is one and only one column\n",
    "    1. Split the data\n",
    "        * Determine if target column has class imbalance. If, so stratify.\n",
    "        * We will do 70/15/15 train/validate/test split.\n",
    "        * **RANDOM_STATE will be 125**\n",
    "    1. Create data dictionary\n",
    "    1. Summarize data transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Explore** data in search of drivers of churn\n",
    "   1. General Inspect\n",
    "       - `.info()` and `.describe()`\n",
    "       - identify continuous and categorical columns\n",
    "   1. Univariate Stats: \n",
    "       - Categorical\n",
    "       - Nunerical\n",
    "   1. Bivariate Stats:\n",
    "       - Categorical features to target relationships\n",
    "       - Continuous features to target relationship\n",
    "       \n",
    "   Ask Specific questions:\n",
    "   - How do monthly charges relate to churn?\n",
    "   - How about total charges, internet service type, and contract type?\n",
    "      \n",
    "* Develop a **model** to predict if a customer will churn\n",
    "   * Use drivers identified in explore to build predictive models of different types\n",
    "   * Create and run a baseline model with `sklearn`'s `DummyClassifier` to compare our results to\n",
    "   * Create and run KNN, Logistic Regression, and Decistion Tree classification models\n",
    "   * Use the insights from the highest-performing model (with highest test accuracy) to confirm our initial hypotheses and insights on the features that are the biggest drivers of churn\n",
    "   \n",
    "* **Evaluate** models on train and validate data\n",
    "   * Identify the metric to maximize\n",
    "       * Do we simply want an accurate model?\n",
    "       * If not is it more costly to incorrectly identify non-churning customers (FN) or churning customers (FP)?\n",
    "   * Select the best model based on highest desired metric\n",
    "\n",
    "* Evaluate the best model on validation data set. After we find the best model, test on the test set.\n",
    "    * Save test predictions to a csv file\n",
    " \n",
    "* Draw conclusions\n",
